# Objective
Women and Children are vulnerable to different kinds of violence. Specially, female students, working women, and women entrepreneurs who use to go outside for study, work and business. Many times they fall victim to different kinds of sexual harassment or physical abuse. Usually we know the information after the incidence occurred. It is difficult for the victims to inform someone about the incidence at that moment. If the information of the incidence with place of occurrence be informed the parents, friends and law enforcing agencies, valuable life could be saved. Another problem is that it is sometimes very difficult and inhuman to prove the guilt and correctly identify wrong doers for the lack of evidence. If evidence could be collected digitally, many of these problems could be resolved.

# Problem Statement
It is also difficult to provide safety instructions to all the women and educate them about their legal rights. It is also tedious job for any particular woman to collect all the information from different sources. It would be a nice idea if we could provide information in their hands through one platform (Mobile Apps and Web Application).
Sometimes it is difficult for the policymakers to know the current crime scenario as there are diverse types of crimes. If these particular types of crime information could be collected, the administration can take rapid actions and plan to combat these kinds of crimes. Most importantly, it will provide the victims an interface to contact the concern persons. The problems identified as follows:
• Lack of timely response of the incidence;
Lack of evidence to prove the offense;
Absence of single device for women safety and legal rights;
• Lack of infrastructure from both victims and policymakers.
